> we propose XXX, a novel system that leverages the prior knowledge of foundational vision large models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. For 3D scene generation, XXX decouples foreground and background elements, extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from the input image, and employs point cloud-guided object pose optimization to achieve more accurate scene alignment. Furthermore, XXX supports texture editing for objects within a scene. We impose constraints on diffusion models and introduce a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, effectively maintaining multi-view texture consistency. By further integrating Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation, we enhance the realism of rendered outputs.
