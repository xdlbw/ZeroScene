> Our method achieves the generation of a 3D digital twin scene from a single RGB image. For foreground objects, we perform high-quality geometry and texture reconstruction of individual assets; for the background, we fit the 3D structure from point clouds. The components are then assembled into a complete scene that is strictly consistent with the spatial layout of the input image.
